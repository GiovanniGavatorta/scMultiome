\title{Annotate ATAC-seq Peaks with Overlapping Genes}
\usage{
AnnotateATACwithGenes(gtf_path, atac_gr)
}
\arguments{
\item{gtf_path}{A string. The path to the `Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.114.gtf.gz` annotation file.}

\item{atac_gr}{A `GRanges` object containing ATAC-seq peak ranges and metadata,
typically generated from `PrepareGRanges()`.}
}
\value{
A `GRanges` object of overlapping ATAC peaks, with metadata columns:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{overlapping_gene_id}: Ensembl gene ID of the overlapping gene
    \item \code{overlapping_gene_name}: Gene name (symbol)
    \item \code{ATAC_sum}: Total ATAC signal per peak (inherited from input)
  }
}
\description{
This function performs Step 5 of the exam:
reads a GTF annotation file, filters for protein-coding genes,
and then finds overlaps between ATAC-seq peaks and these genes. It returns a
`GRanges` object of ATAC peaks annotated with gene information.

\title{Summarize Gene Expression and ATAC-seq Data}
\usage{
SummarizeData(gene_expr_dt, atac_peaks_dt)
}
\arguments{
\item{gene_expr_dt}{A `data.table` containing gene expression data (genes as rows, cells as columns).
The first column should be gene IDs or row names and is excluded from the sum.}

\item{atac_peaks_dt}{A `data.table` containing ATAC-seq data (peaks as rows, cells as columns).
The first column should be peak coordinates and is excluded from the sum.}
}
\value{
A list with two named numeric vectors:
\describe{
  \item{gene_totals}{Total gene expression counts per cell (numeric vector).}
  \item{atac_totals}{Total chromatin accessibility counts per cell (numeric vector).}
}
}
\description{
This function performs Step 3 of the exam:
It computes the total counts per cell by summing across rows (genes or peaks)
in both gene expression and ATAC-seq peak `data.table`s.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming you've split your data using SplitGeneAndAtac()
result <- SummarizeData(gene_expr_dt, atac_peaks_dt)
head(result$gene_totals)
head(result$atac_totals)
}
}
